# Frauddit
Frauddit addresses the increasing problem of online fraud by creating a decentralized platform for users to report fraud incidents in real-time. Traditional fraud reporting systems rely on centralized authorities, often leading to slow response times and lack of community awareness. Frauddit empowers users to instantly report fraud, ensuring fast alerts and a transparent system that prevents exploitation.

It allows users to report fraud incidents, view real-time reports, and receive notifications on new fraud cases. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures that the reports are immutable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. The platform integrates decentralized principles with real-time alerting, making it easier for users to stay informed and protect themselves from potential fraud.
